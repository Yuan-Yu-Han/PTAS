They've become the backbone of many modern NLP applications, including machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling.\n\nA defining feature of transformers is their ability to process entire input sequences simultaneously. Unlike traditional recurrent models, which handle one token at a time, transformers leverage a self-attention mechanism to analyze relationships between all elements in a sequence at once. This enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input context more efficiently and with greater flexibility.\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll explore how to build a machine translation system using the transformer architecture.\n\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006891,"end_time":"2025-07-06T09:16:55.133831","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-07-06T09:16:55.126940","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"43eb9577"}},{"id":"CW0ahnTWB-WA","cell_type":"code","source":"#
